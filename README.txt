Automatic Shape Memory Alloy Data Analyzer (ASMADA) source code v 1.0 (last updated April 2021). 


SUMMARY:
This project serves to automatically analyze isobaric thermal cycling tests of Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) in accordance with ASTM standard E3097-17. This code accompanies a journal manuscript:
Matthew C. Kuner, Anargyros A. Karakalas, and Dimitris C. Lagoudas, 
"ASMADA â€“ A Tool for Automatic Analysis of Shape Memory Alloy Thermal Cycling Data under Constant Stress",
[JOURNAL NAME] (YEAR), DOI: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


FUNCTIONALITY:
This software provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to allow users to easily input their own experimental data into the tool. This tool then performs the following functions:
i) identify thermal cycles from the raw data.
ii) apply a pre-defined set of processes to determine twenty-three (23) material properties/parameters, including the four (4) transformation start/finish points. All but three of these properties are defined within the aforementioned ASTM standard.
iii) create figures showing the evolution of key properties, alongside an animation showing the tangent line fitting used to determine the transformation start/finish points.
iv) export the figures, animation, and a spreadsheet or txt document containing the numerical values for each of the properties obtained from each cycle.


INSTALLATION:
This project was developed in Python 3.7.3. *If* you plan on using the source code, rather than an application (.exe or .dmg) format, then you will need to download the same packages used in developing this project. All packages and versions used in developing this application can be found in the provided "requirements.txt" file. These packages can be easily downloaded by running the following in your command prompt (or Terminal, etc.):
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
or running the equivalent within a virtual environment.
